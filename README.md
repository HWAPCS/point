# Point
Create a Point class which has two instance variable for the x and y coordinates.
Write a constructor and one method called distance(Point otherPoint), which returns the distance between this point and otherPoint.

Write a PointTester class which asks for two points and prints the distance between them.

Save these classes in the src folder, and make a pull request when you are ready to submit.
